**Banana**
- Overview:
    - Russia: 4 items, no outliers.
    - Vietnam: 9 items, with no outliers.
- Prices:
    - Russia:
        - Median price = 1.88 USD/kg (~ 170 RUB/kg; ~ 47900 VND/kg).
        - The cheapest item is priced at 1.86 USD/kg, which isn't significantly different from the median.
    - Vietnam: Median price = 1.16 USD/kg (~ 105 RUB/kg; ~ 29500 VND/kg) (38% cheaper overall)
    - If comparing only long bananas (most similar to those sold in Russia), the median price in Vietnam rises to 1.41 USD/kg (~ 127 RUB/kg; ~ 35900 VND/kg) (25% cheaper).
- Key Observations:
    - All bananas in Russia are imported and consist of a single type (long bananas). Vietnam’s market is more diverse, including locally grown bananas and imports from nearby countries.
    - Even imported bananas in Vietnam are cheaper than in Russia, likely due to lower transportation costs.
    - The limited data points might influence conclusions, but given the supermarkets’ large market share, the sample represents the category's available diversity.
