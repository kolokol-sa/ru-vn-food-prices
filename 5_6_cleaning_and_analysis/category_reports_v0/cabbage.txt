- Overview:
    - Russia: 3 items, no outliers (but 1 notable item: a "new harvest" cabbage).
    - Vietnam: 3 items, no outliers.
- Prices:
    - Russia: Median price = 0.57 USD/kg (~ 52 RUB/kg; ~ 14700 VND/kg)
    - Vietnam: Median price = 0.62 USD/kg (~ 56 RUB/kg; ~ 15900 VND/kg) (8% more expensive overall)

- Key Observations:
    - The small sample sizes in both countries make it challenging to draw solid conclusions, but overall cabbage in Russia seems notably cheaper than in Vietnam.
