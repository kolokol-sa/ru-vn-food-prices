**Banana**
- Overview:
    - Russia: 4 items, no outliers.
    - Vietnam: 9 items, with no outliers.
- Prices:
    - Russia:
        - Median price = 1.88 USD/kg (~ 170 RUB/kg; ~ 47900 VND/kg).
        - The cheapest item is priced at 1.86 USD/kg, which isn't significantly different from the median.
    - Vietnam: Median price = 1.16 USD/kg (~ 105 RUB/kg; ~ 29500 VND/kg) (38% cheaper overall)
    - If comparing only long bananas (most similar to those sold in Russia), the median price in Vietnam rises to 1.41 USD/kg (~ 127 RUB/kg; ~ 35900 VND/kg) (25% cheaper).
- Key Observations:
    - All bananas in Russia are imported and consist of a single type (long bananas). Vietnam’s market is more diverse, including locally grown bananas and imports from nearby countries.
    - Even imported bananas in Vietnam are cheaper than in Russia, likely due to lower transportation costs.
    - The limited data points might influence conclusions, but given the supermarkets’ large market share, the sample represents the category's available diversity.

- Outliers:
    - Russia: include 2 cheapest breads below 0.81 USD/kg and 3 most expensive above 6.85 USD/kg (a premium sourdough bread with nuts and gluten-free bread)
- Key Observations:
    - Bread in Russia is highly diverse, made with various types of flour and preparation methods, reflecting its role as a dietary staple and high consumer demand.
    - Vietnam’s bread selection in supermarkets is limited to a small variety of fresh baked baguettes and packaged sandwich bread, which may indicate lower demand.
    - Bread’s higher price in Vietnam may be due to its lower popularity and limited local production. Unlike Russia, where bread is widely consumed, Vietnam relies on rice as the primary crop, with wheat being imported—contributing to higher prices and reduced diversity.
