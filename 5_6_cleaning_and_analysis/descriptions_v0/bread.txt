- Key Observations:
    - Bread in Russia is highly diverse, made with various types of flour and preparation methods, reflecting its role as a dietary staple and high consumer demand.
    - Vietnam’s bread selection in supermarkets is limited to a small variety of fresh baked baguettes and packaged sandwich bread, which may indicate lower demand.
    - Bread’s higher price in Vietnam may be due to its lower popularity and limited local production. Unlike Russia, where bread is widely consumed, Vietnam relies on rice as the primary crop, with wheat being imported—contributing to higher prices and reduced diversity.
