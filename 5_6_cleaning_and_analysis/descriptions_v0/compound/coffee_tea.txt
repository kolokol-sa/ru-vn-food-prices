**Drinks (Tea and Coffee)**

- Cheaper in Vietnam:  
    - Coffee (2x cheaper; median price 51% lower).  

- Comparable Prices:  
    - Green tea (nearly identical median prices, with slight variations in product variety).  

- More Expensive in Vietnam:  
    - Black tea (38% more expensive overall; locally produced varieties narrow the gap but remain 18% more expensive).  

- Key Observations:  
  - Tea:  
    - Black tea is a cultural staple in Russia, leading to lower median prices and a wider variety, including flavored and affordable options. In Vietnam, black tea demand is smaller and segmented into local and imported categories, driving up the median price.  
    - Green tea is priced similarly in both countries, but Russia’s offerings emphasize flavored tea bags and premium options, while Vietnam focuses on traditional loose-leaf tea for daily use or milk tea preparation.  

  - Coffee:  
    - Vietnam’s robust coffee industry allows for significantly lower prices and abundant availability of ground coffee. Russia’s reliance on imports contributes to higher prices, though some affordable options are available.
