- Key Observations:  
    - Vietnam’s favorable climate likely drives lower prices for most vegetables, reducing the need for costly greenhouse production.  
    - Russia’s reliance on greenhouses and seasonal imports, especially during colder months, leads to higher prices for items like cucumbers, tomatoes, and eggplants.  
    - Staple vegetables like cabbage and carrots have smaller price differences, reflecting their adaptability to both climates.
