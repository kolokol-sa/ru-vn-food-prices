- Key Observations:
    - Black tea is a cultural staple in Russia, which may contribute to demand for a wide variety of flavors and price points. Imported raw tea is likely processed locally, keeping prices relatively low.
    - Vietnamâ€™s black tea market appears segmented into three groups: locally produced (cheaper), imported affordable (like Sri Lankan), and premium European imports (most expensive).
    - Higher median prices in Vietnam may reflect the smaller demand and a preference for premium products over diverse, affordable options.
