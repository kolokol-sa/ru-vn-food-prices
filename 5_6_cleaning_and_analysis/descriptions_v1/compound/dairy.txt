Milk is cheaper in Russia, thanks to local production and standard packaging sizes; in Vietnam, smaller packaging and a mix of local and imported products raise the per-liter price.

Yogurt is more affordable in Vietnam, likely due to simpler offerings and lower production costs, while Russiaâ€™s broader variety contributes to higher prices.

Overall, dairy affordability reflects local production capabilities and product diversity in each market.
