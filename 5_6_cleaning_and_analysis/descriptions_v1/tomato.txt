• Tomatoes in Russia are over 5x more expensive overall, but that’s partly due to a clear gap between regular and cherry varieties.

• Regular tomatoes are far cheaper in both countries, but still 4.3x more expensive in Russia (5.59 vs 1.29 USD/kg in Vietnam).

• Cherry-like tomatoes are a premium product in both markets, and cost 4.5x more in Russia than in Vietnam (13.53 vs 2.99 USD/kg).

• The difference is likely tied to Russia’s need for greenhouse production during colder months (especially relevant since the data was collected in early March), along with possible higher transport and import costs — whereas Vietnam benefits from year-round local farming and a favorable climate.
