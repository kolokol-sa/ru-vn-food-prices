cucumber,"• Cucumbers are 77% (4.3×) cheaper in Vietnam.

• Even Russia’s cheapest options are pricier than Vietnam’s median, making cucumbers notably less affordable.

• The difference is likely due to Russia’s reliance on greenhouse production in colder months, while Vietnam’s warm climate supports year-round growing. This is especially relevant since the data was collected in early March, still within Russia’s winter season."
ground_coffee,"• Coffee in Vietnam is about 51% cheaper than in Russia (2x difference).

• Local production keeps Vietnamese prices low, while Russia depends on imports.

• Although Russia has a wider selection, over 90% of its options are priced well above Vietnam’s median."
carrot,"• Prices are nearly identical — Vietnam is only 3–5% more expensive depending on the type.

• Regular-sized carrots (excluding baby carrots) are 0.98 USD/kg in Vietnam vs. 0.93 USD/kg in Russia.

• Small sample sizes in both countries suggest the difference may not be meaningful."
chicken_fillet,"• Chicken fillet is 33% cheaper in Vietnam overall.

• One Russian item is priced at 3.65 USD/kg, close to Vietnam’s median, but it's an outlier and may not reflect typical prices.

• Small sample sizes limit certainty, but the price gap is still significant."
banana,"• Bananas in Vietnam are 38% cheaper overall than in Russia. For long bananas (comparable to those sold in Russia), the median price is 1.41 USD/kg, still about 25% cheaper.

• The lower prices in Vietnam may reflect local production and shorter transport distances, though this is based on limited available data.

• Russia offers only one type of banana, all imported, which may contribute to higher and less flexible pricing."
cabbage,"• Cabbage is moderately more expensive in Vietnam — about 8% higher on average, or up to 22% when excluding a notably pricier ""new harvest"" cabbage in Russia.

• Russian prices are generally lower, though the sample size in both countries is very small.

• While data is limited, the available prices suggest better affordability in Russia."
pork_leg,"• Pork leg is 28% more expensive in Vietnam overall.

• Despite its popularity, even Vietnam’s cheapest options (5.23–5.68 USD/kg) are still above Russia’s median.

• The price gap may reflect supply chain differences, local demand, or production costs."
salt,"• Salt is 77% (4.4x) cheaper in Vietnam overall.

• Russia shows a much wider price range, with a few ultra-cheap options starting at 0.15 USD/kg, but many products priced significantly higher, pulling the median up.

• Vietnam’s consistently low prices reflect a narrower, locally driven market — the difference likely comes down to local production and less variation in product types."
water,"• Water in Vietnam is 39% cheaper by median, though the cheapest 10% of options are comparable in both countries — up to 0.23 USD/l in Vietnam vs up to 0.27 USD/l in Russia.

• Russia’s higher median likely reflects a broader price range, which could be driven by a wider selection of bottled water types — including various mineral compositions and sources."
mango,"• Mango is about 69% (3.2x) cheaper in Vietnam, thanks to local production.

• In Russia, mangoes are imported, which raises prices.

• Russia’s limited sample size makes it hard to assess variety or typical price spread."
milk,"• Milk is 36% more expensive in Vietnam overall.

• In Russia, milk is mostly locally produced and sold in standard packages, keeping the median price lower.

• In Vietnam, both local and imported brands are common, and smaller packaging is more frequent—factors that raise the price per liter.

• While Vietnam does offer options priced similarly to Russia, 90% of items are still above Russia's median, showing a clear overall difference."
water_spinach,"• Water spinach is widely available and moderately priced in Vietnam, but not found in Russian stores"
sugar,"• Sugar is 16% cheaper in Vietnam by median, but Russia offers budget options priced as low as 0.66–0.91 USD/kg, which are below Vietnam’s cheapest, making overall prices fairly comparable.

• Vietnam’s pricing is more consistent, with less variation—its cheapest and most expensive options remain within a narrower range."
rice_noodles,"• Rice noodles are 67% (3x) cheaper in Vietnam.

• In Vietnam, they’re a staple with widespread local production — unlike in Russia, where they’re uncommon and mostly imported.

• Even the cheapest option in Russia costs 7.05 USD/kg, which is still well above Vietnam’s median, highlighting the impact of import costs and lower local demand."
soybean_oil,• Soybean oil is commonly available in Vietnam but not found in the Russian dataset.
rice,"• Rice is 44% cheaper in Vietnam overall.

• While Russia's median is higher, the cheapest 10% of items are close to Vietnam’s typical prices — showing affordable options still exist.

• Vietnam’s year-round tropical farming and lower production costs likely explain the difference, while Russia’s rice production is more limited and seasonal."
buckwheat,"• Buckwheat is 2.3x more expensive in Vietnam, with the only available item priced at 4.20 USD/kg.

• In Russia, buckwheat is a staple food, widely available and affordable.

• In Vietnam, it's a rare, imported niche product, which likely explains the high price."
eggplant,"• In Vietnam, eggplant is 69% cheaper than in Russia — a striking price difference.

• The cost gap likely reflects climate: Vietnam’s growing conditions are more suitable, while Russia may rely on greenhouse production, raising prices.

• Small sample sizes in both countries mean this insight should be taken with some caution."
spaghetti,"• Spaghetti is over twice as expensive in Vietnam by median, with even the cheapest options priced well above Russia’s median.

• Russia benefits from local production, keeping prices low and offering budget-friendly options.

• In Vietnam, higher prices likely stem from reliance on imports and spaghetti being a less common staple."
fish_sauce,"• Fish sauce in Vietnam is 46% cheaper than in Russia.

• In Russia, it’s a niche, imported product with low demand — likely explaining the high price.

• With only one item available in Russia, deeper comparison isn’t possible."
egg,"• In Vietnam, a pack of 10 eggs costs 1.35 USD, which is 11% cheaper than in Russia (1.51 USD). (Chart shows price per 1 egg.)

• The typical price range is nearly the same in both countries, suggesting eggs are similarly affordable."
bread,"• Bread is 31% more expensive per kg in Vietnam overall, but fresh baguettes priced at 1.70–2.20 USD/kg are comparable to Russia’s median (2.24 USD/kg), offering some affordable options.

• Russia’s bread market is diverse and affordable, reflecting high demand and domestic wheat production.

• In Vietnam, higher prices and limited variety likely stem from lower popularity, imported wheat, and rice being the dominant staple."
tomato,"• Tomatoes in Russia are over 5x more expensive overall, but that’s partly due to a clear gap between regular and cherry varieties.

• Regular tomatoes are far cheaper in both countries, but still 4.3x more expensive in Russia (5.59 vs 1.29 USD/kg in Vietnam).

• Cherry-like tomatoes are a premium product in both markets, and cost 4.5x more in Russia than in Vietnam (13.53 vs 2.99 USD/kg).

• The difference is likely tied to Russia’s need for greenhouse production during colder months (especially relevant since the data was collected in early March), along with possible higher transport and import costs — whereas Vietnam benefits from year-round local farming and a favorable climate."
yogurt,"• Yogurt is 43% cheaper in Vietnam by median, though Russia offers some budget options comparable to Vietnamese prices.

• However, 90% of Russian items are priced above Vietnam’s median, indicating a generally higher price range.

• Vietnam’s lower prices may reflect simpler product offerings and lower production costs, while Russia’s variety of flavors and quality push prices up."

• Vietnam offers both local and imported options:
Local = 0.94 USD/kg (2.5x cheaper than Russian median)
Imported = 2.86 USD/kg (more expensive than in Russia)

• Higher import prices in Vietnam may be due to transportation costs and lower demand, since local oranges are widely available."
black_tea,"• A standard 25-bag pack of black tea costs 1.16 USD in Russia and 1.60 USD in Vietnam—38% more expensive overall. Even the cheapest locally produced tea in Vietnam averages 1.37 USD/pack (~18% more). (Chart shows price per kg)

• Russia's broad selection and lower prices likely stem from local processing of imported tea and strong cultural demand.

• In Vietnam, the higher prices may reflect a smaller market and a preference for premium imports, with fewer affordable options available."
tofu,"• Tofu is over 5x cheaper in Vietnam.

• Tofu is a widely consumed, locally produced staple in Vietnam, keeping prices low.

• In Russia, tofu is less common and likely costlier due to smaller production or reliance on imports."
onion,"• Onions are 32% more expensive in Vietnam overall.

• Broader domestic production in Russia likely helps keep prices lower.

• Vietnam’s cheapest option is comparable, but most are pricier. Small sample size limits conclusions."
sunflower_oil,"• Sunflower oil is 84% more expensive in Vietnam by median, with even the cheapest options (2.67–2.96 USD/l) priced well above Russia’s median.

• In Russia, sunflower oil is a staple cooking product, helping keep prices low.

• In Vietnam, it’s less commonly used, and surprisingly, locally produced sunflower oil is priced on par with imported brands—suggesting that domestic production costs is notably high."
green_tea,"• Prices are nearly identical in both countries — around 1.22 USD per standard 25-bag pack. (Chart shows price per kg)

• Russia offers more variety, including flavored and premium teas, while Vietnam mostly sells traditional loose-leaf types for everyday use or milk tea.

• These differences reflect local preferences and consumption habits more than pricing."
