• Bananas in Vietnam are 38% cheaper overall than in Russia. For long bananas (comparable to those sold in Russia), the median price is 1.41 USD/kg, still about 25% cheaper.

• The lower prices in Vietnam may reflect local production and shorter transport distances, though this is based on limited available data.

• Russia offers only one type of banana, all imported, which may contribute to higher and less flexible pricing.
