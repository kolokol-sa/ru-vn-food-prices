    - Yogurt is generally cheaper in Vietnam.
    - Russia's 10% cheapest group lies below Vietnam's median, which means affordable and comparable options are available. But, actually, the other 90% are exactly higher than Vietnam's median, so generally, price difference is significant.
    - Vietnam's lower prices likely reflect differences in production costs and simpler product offerings (Russia has a wider range of flavors and quality).
