**Dairy Products**

- Cheaper in Vietnam:  
    - Yogurt (43% cheaper overall).  

- More Expensive in Vietnam:  
    - Milk (36% more expensive overall, though Vietnam’s cheapest options are comparable to Russia’s median).  

- Key Observations:  
  - Milk:  
    - Milk is primarily locally produced in Russia, keeping prices relatively low. In Vietnam, milk prices are higher, likely due to a mix of local and imported products and smaller packaging sizes, which increase the price per liter.  
    - While Vietnam offers some affordable options, the majority of products are priced higher than Russia’s median, reflecting a notable difference in affordability.  

  - Yogurt:  
    - Yogurt is significantly cheaper in Vietnam, likely due to simpler product offerings and lower production costs.  
    - Russia’s wider variety of yogurt flavors and quality levels contributes to a higher median price, with most items exceeding Vietnam’s median.  
  - These differences highlight how local production and product diversity impact the affordability of dairy products in each country.
