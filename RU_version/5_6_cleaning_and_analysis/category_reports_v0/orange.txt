    - Locally produced oranges in Vietnam are much cheaper than imported ones (3x) and than oranges in Russia (2.5x). But imported oranges in Vietnam are more expensive than imported oranges in Russia.
    - The difference in imported oranges prices can be attributed to higher transportation costs and, probably, lower demand in Vietnam, as it has it's own production.
